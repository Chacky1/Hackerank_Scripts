# Hackerank_Scripts

## Objective

This repo gathers scripts I made for Hackerank.
This is a learning platform for development.
It is made in the spirit that we should learn by practicing the languages on real exercices.
Some of them are about data structures or famous algorithms.
It can allow a company to identify special skills such as :
- how much the developer cares about learning not only the language but also sata structures, sorting algorithms or other famous ones
- how much attention the developer gives to proper code
- how the developer thinks

## My thinking about the code

Being able to deliver software products is not sufficent and every developer should pay attention to the structure of it as well as the maintenance of it.
The code should be kept as readable as possible meaning that the developer is in charge of "upgrading" the code along the time.
